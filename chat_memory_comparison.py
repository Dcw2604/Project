"""
Chat Memory Comparison: Current System vs LangChain Enhanced

This file demonstrates the difference between the two memory approaches
"""

# EXAMPLE 1: Current System (Database Memory)
# Student conversation over multiple days:

# Day 1:
# Student: "What is 2+2?"
# AI: "2+2 = 4"
# [Saved to database: ChatInteraction(question="What is 2+2?", answer="2+2 = 4")]

# Day 2:
# Student: "What about calculus?"
# AI: "Calculus is the study of change..." 
# [AI has NO context from Day 1 - treats as new conversation]

# EXAMPLE 2: LangChain Enhanced (Session Memory + Database)
# Same student, same session:

# Student: "What is 2+2?"
# AI: "2+2 = 4"
# [Saved to database AND kept in LangChain memory]

# Student: "What about harder math?"
# AI: "Since you're asking about math after our discussion of basic arithmetic, 
#      let me suggest some intermediate topics like algebra or geometry..."
# [AI remembers the previous 2+2 question in the same session]

# BENEFITS OF COMBINED APPROACH:
# 1. Database: Permanent storage, training data, analytics
# 2. LangChain: Better conversation flow, contextual responses
# 3. Together: Rich immediate context + long-term learning

# IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
# 1. Keep your current chat_interaction endpoint (it works great!)
# 2. Add enhanced_chat_interaction as optional upgrade
# 3. Let users choose between basic and enhanced chat
# 4. Both save to same ChatInteraction database table

print("Your current system already provides excellent persistent memory!")
print("LangChain would add conversational context for richer interactions.")
print("You can implement both approaches side by side.")
