# Interactive Exam Chatbot Implementation Summary

## Overview

The interactive exam chatbot system has been successfully updated to meet all the specified requirements. The system now provides a seamless chat-based exam experience where students answer questions from teacher-uploaded documents with a 3-attempt system and intelligent hints.

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Question Fetching from Teacher Documents Only

- **Backend**: Updated `start_interactive_exam()` function to only use documents uploaded by teachers
- **Validation**: Added checks to ensure `document.uploaded_by.role == 'teacher'`
- **Auto-selection**: When no specific document is provided, the system automatically selects from teacher documents only
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages when no teacher documents are available

### 2. One-by-One Question Presentation

- **Chat Interface**: Questions are presented sequentially in the chat interface
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress display showing current question and completion percentage
- **Session State**: Maintains current question index and exam state throughout the session

### 3. 3-Attempt System with Hints

- **Attempt Tracking**: Each question allows up to 3 attempts
- **Intelligent Hints**: AI-generated hints that become more specific with each attempt
- **Hint Generation**: Uses Ollama to generate contextual hints based on document content
- **Progressive Guidance**: Hints guide students toward the correct answer without giving it away

### 4. Session State Management

- **Persistent State**: Exam progress is saved in `ChatSession` metadata
- **Question States**: Individual question states track attempts, hints, and correctness
- **Resume Capability**: Students can resume their exam from where they left off
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates of answered questions, total questions, and completion percentage

### 5. Consistent API Endpoints

- **Unified Backend**: `submit_interactive_exam_answer()` handles both ChatSession and ExamSession approaches
- **Progress API**: `get_interactive_exam_progress()` works with both session types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
- **Response Format**: Consistent response format across all endpoints

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

).exclude(extracted_text='').order_by('-created_at')
```
