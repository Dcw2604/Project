# Task 2.2: Store Exam Configuration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive exam configuration storage system that allows teachers to save exam configurations with ordered questions, scheduling, and metadata persistence.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Models (`scheduler/models.py`)

#### ExamConfig Model
- **Purpose**: Store exam configuration metadata and scheduling
- **Fields**:
  - `exam_session`: Foreign key to ExamSession (required)
  - `teacher`: Foreign key to User with teacher role (required)
  - `assigned_student`: Foreign key to User with student role (optional)
  - `start_time`: DateTime for exam start (required)
  - `end_time`: DateTime for exam end (required)
  - `created_at`: Auto timestamp for creation
  - `updated_at`: Auto timestamp for updates
- **Constraints**:
  - Unique constraint on (exam_session, teacher) to prevent duplicates
  - Check constraint ensuring end_time > start_time
  - Teacher role validation

#### ExamConfigQuestion Model
- **Purpose**: Store ordered question sequences for exam configurations
- **Fields**:
  - `exam_config`: Foreign key to ExamConfig (required)
  - `question`: Foreign key to QuestionBank (required)
  - `order_index`: Integer for question ordering (required)
- **Constraints**:
  - Unique constraint on (exam_config, question) to prevent duplicate questions
  - Unique constraint on (exam_config, order_index) to ensure proper ordering

### 2. Serializers (`scheduler/serializers.py`)

#### ExamConfigSerializer
- **Features**:
  - Read/write serialization with nested question handling
  - Comprehensive validation for all fields
  - Bulk creation of ExamConfigQuestion objects
  - Nested serialization for teacher, student, exam_session, and questions
- **Validation**:
  - Teacher existence and role validation
  - Student existence and role validation (when provided)
  - Order index validation (must start from 1, no gaps, no duplicates)
  - Time validation (end_time must be after start_time)
  - Question existence validation

### 3. Views (`scheduler/views.py`)

#### ExamConfigViewSet
- **Base**: Django REST Framework ModelViewSet
- **Operations**: Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Features**:
  - Role-based queryset filtering
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Anonymous access for development
  - Query parameter filtering by exam_session_id
- **Permissions**: Temporarily disabled for development testing

### 4. URL Configuration (`scheduler/urls.py`)
- **Endpoint**: `/api/exam-configs/`
- **Router**: DRF DefaultRouter with basename 'exam-config'
- **Supported Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

### 5. Admin Interface (`scheduler/admin.py`)

#### ExamConfigAdmin
- **Features**:
  - Organized fieldsets (Basic Information, Scheduling, Metadata)
  - List display with key fields
  - Filtering by teacher and exam session
  - Search functionality
  - Read-only timestamps

#### ExamConfigQuestionAdmin
- **Features**:
  - List display with exam session title
  - Filtering by exam session and teacher
  - Search by exam session title and question text
  - Ordering by configuration and question order

### 6. Database Migration
- **Migration**: `scheduler.0015_examconfig_examconfigquestion`
- **Status**: Successfully applied
- **Tables Created**:
  - `scheduler_examconfig`
  - `scheduler_examconfigquestion`

## API Endpoints

### Create Exam Configuration
```http
POST /api/exam-configs/
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "exam_session_id": 7,
    "teacher_id": 4,
    "assigned_student_id": 1,
    "start_time": "2025-08-09T20:00:00Z",
    "end_time": "2025-08-09T22:00:00Z",
    "questions": [
        {"question_id": 136, "order_index": 1},
        {"question_id": 133, "order_index": 2}
    ]
}
```

### List Exam Configurations
```http
GET /api/exam-configs/
```

### Retrieve Specific Configuration
```http
GET /api/exam-configs/{id}/
```

### Filter by Exam Session
```http
GET /api/exam-configs/?exam_session_id=7
```

## Testing Results

### âœ… Successful Tests
1. **Configuration Creation**: Successfully creates exam configurations with ordered questions
2. **Data Retrieval**: Properly retrieves individual configurations with nested data
3. **List Functionality**: Successfully lists all configurations
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive validation working for all required fields
5. **Database Constraints**: Unique constraints preventing data inconsistency
6. **Admin Interface**: Full admin functionality for configuration management

### âœ… Validation Tests
1. **Missing required fields**: Properly returns 400 Bad Request
2. **Invalid teacher/student IDs**: Validates user existence and roles
3. **Time constraints**: Validates end_time > start_time
4. **Question ordering**: Validates proper order indices
5. **Duplicate prevention**: Unique constraints working correctly

### ðŸ“Š Current Database State
- **Exam Sessions**: 7
- **Teachers**: 2
- **Students**: 4
- **Questions**: 92
- **Exam Configurations**: 3 (created during testing)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Data Persistence
- Complete exam configuration storage with metadata
- Ordered question sequences with constraints
- Teacher and student assignment tracking
- Scheduling information with validation

### 2. Data Integrity
- Unique constraints preventing duplicate configurations
- Role validation for teachers and students
- Time validation ensuring logical scheduling
- Question ordering validation

### 3. API Functionality
- RESTful API endpoints for all CRUD operations
